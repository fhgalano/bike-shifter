Electric shifter for a deraileur

Current Status:
8/9/2022 - Working on the mechanical design of the system. Originally planned on just 
using a high torque servo, but some analysis is suggesting that I will need to use a worm
gear to prevent kickback into the system from the force in the gears.
Also, my test bike is being used by a friend.
